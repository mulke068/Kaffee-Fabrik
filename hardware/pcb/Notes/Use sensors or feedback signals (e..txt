Use sensors or feedback signals (e.g., Hall effect, encoders) to determine motor states.
Overcurrent protection for each motor driver using polyfuses or electronic current limiters.
ESD protection diodes on inputs/outputs.
Use a reverse-polarity protection diode (e.g., Schottky diode) on the 24V line.
